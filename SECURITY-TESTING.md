# Automated Security Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the automated security testing approach implemented for the Divizend Companion mobile application. The security pipeline incorporates industry-standard practices for Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) without relying on paid services.

## Security Testing Tools & Approach

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

SAST tools analyze source code to identify potential security vulnerabilities without executing the application.

| Tool                   | Purpose                                | Implementation                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub CodeQL          | Semantic code analysis                 | Integrated in CI/CD pipeline to detect code vulnerabilities     |
| ESLint Security Plugin | JavaScript/TypeScript security linting | Enforces secure coding practices through linting rules          |
| Semgrep                | Pattern-based code scanning            | Scans for security anti-patterns and vulnerable code constructs |

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

DAST tools test the running application to identify vulnerabilities in its runtime environment.

| Tool                              | Purpose                           | Implementation                                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| MobSF (Mobile Security Framework) | Mobile app security scanning      | Analyzes mobile app components for security issues       |
| Expo Doctor                       | Configuration security validation | Checks Expo configuration for security misconfigurations |
| React Native Doctor               | Environment validation            | Validates React Native environment for security issues   |

### Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

SCA tools identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies and open-source components.

| Tool                   | Purpose                                | Implementation                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| NPM Audit              | Node.js package vulnerability scanning | Detects known vulnerabilities in Node.js dependencies |
| OWASP Dependency Check | Open-source component analysis         | Identifies vulnerable components by CVE/CPE mapping   |

### Secret Detection

| Tool     | Purpose                        | Implementation                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Gitleaks | Secret and credential scanning | Detects hardcoded secrets, API keys, and credentials |

## Testing Frequency & Triggers

The automated security testing pipeline runs on the following events:

1. On every pull request to `main` or `develop` branches
2. On every push to `main` or `develop` branches
3. Weekly scheduled scans (Sunday at midnight UTC)

## Security Reports & Dashboards

Test results are captured as artifacts in GitHub Actions:

1. **Test Coverage Report**: Shows code coverage statistics from Jest tests
2. **Dependency Check Report**: Contains detailed information about vulnerable dependencies
3. **Consolidated Security Report**: Summarizes findings from all security testing tools

## CI/CD Pipeline Integration

The security pipeline is fully integrated into the CI/CD process, ensuring that:

1. All code changes undergo security testing before deployment
2. Failed security checks generate notifications to the development team
3. Historical security testing data is preserved for trend analysis

## Remediation Process

When security vulnerabilities are detected:

1. High severity issues block the pipeline and prevent deployment
2. Medium and low severity issues are logged for review
3. All findings are documented in the generated security reports
4. Development team is notified of pending security issues

## Conclusion

This automated security testing implementation provides comprehensive coverage of potential security vulnerabilities through the software development lifecycle, ensuring that security issues are identified and remediated early in the development process.
